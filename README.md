More Furniture is a small mod that adds about a dozen new items into Rimworld. It was created so you&apos;d have more variety when choosing things to fill your colonist&apos;s rooms with. Originally created by Anonemous2, development continued by me.

#  Compatibility
 

More Furniture can be safely added into existing saves, But all new items should be deleted before disabling the mod. Does not require any other mods to work, and it should be compatible with most other mods.
