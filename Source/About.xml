  <description>More Furniture, does what you'd expect, it adds more furniture. Was originally created so I'd have stuff to put inside my colonist's rooms, but It now includes several items for other uses. There may be occasional updates adding new items into the mod. More Furniture is old save compatible and does not require any other mods to work. Contains: 
New End tables/with or without lamps 
A new Dresser 
New Chairs, and a modular couch 
A tiny table 
Counter tops 
New plant pots/some with art 
A filling cabinet 
Four new carpet to match beds 
 
You can find these new items under the Furniture+ when placing blueprints.
(1.1.0 + 1.2.0)
